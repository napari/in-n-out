# Getting Started

## Providers, Processors, and Stores

`in-n-out` is a dependency injection framework for Python.  It allows
you to write functions using type annotations, and then inject
dependencies into those functions at call time. Two important concepts
in `in-n-out` are *providers* and *processors*.

- **Providers** are functions that may be called with no arguments
  and return an instance of a type.
- **Processors** are functions that take an instance of a type and
  do something with it.

A [`Store`][in_n_out.Store] is a collection of providers and processors.
You will usually begin by creating a `Store` instance to manage your providers and
processors.

```python
from in_n_out import Store

store = Store.create('my-store')
```

This store can be retrieved later using `Store.get_store`, and
destroyed using `Store.destroy`.

```python
store = Store.get_store('my-store')

# Store.destroy('my-store') # would destroy the store... but we still want it :)
```

!!!info "The global store"
    For convenience, any store methods accessed at the top level namespace will
    use a global store, unless a store name or instance is passed

## Registering Providers

Dependency inject works by providing an instance of a type to a function
or method that requires it.  Let's being by declaring some type that will be
important to our application:

```python
class Thing:
    """Some thing I care about."""
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
```

Providers are registered using the [`Store.register_provider`][in_n_out.Store.register_provider].  They are functions that may be called with no arguments
and return an instance of a type.  `in-n-out` will inspect the type annotations
of the function to determine what type it provides.

```python
import in_n_out as ino

def heres_the_thing() -> Thing:
    return Thing("Thing")

# register a provider of Thing
store.register_provider(heres_the_thing)
```

!!!tip "decorators"
    Registration functions may also be used as decorators:

    ```python
    @store.register_provider
    def heres_the_thing() -> Thing:
        return Thing("Thing")
    ```

!!!note
    If you prefer not to use type annotations, or prefer to be explicit about
    the type the provider provides, you may pass a `type_hint` argument:

    ```python
    store.register_provider(heres_the_thing, Thing)
    ```

### Injecting dependencies into functions

Once you have registered a provider, you can use it to inject dependencies
into functions.  Let's say we have a function that can use a `Thing`:

```python
def get_things_name(thing: Thing) -> str:
    return thing.name
```

Naturally, this function will fail if we try to call it without providing
a `Thing`:

```python
get_things_name()
# TypeError: get_things_name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'thing'
```

We can use the [`Store.inject`][in_n_out.Store.inject] method to inject a `Thing` into the function:

```python
get_things_name = store.inject(get_things_name)
print(get_things_name())  # prints "Thing"
```

!!!tip "decorators"
    As with registration functions, we can use `Store.inject` as a decorator:

    ```python
    @store.inject
    def get_things_name(thing: Thing) -> str:
        return thing.name

    print(get_things_name())  # prints "Thing"
    ```

If the store is unable to find a provider for a required type, it will raise
an exception:

```python
@store.inject
def give_me_a_string(s: str) -> str:
    return s

give_me_a_string()
# TypeError: After injecting dependencies for NO arguments,
#   give_me_a_string() missing 1 required positional argument: 's'
```

### Weights and provider priority

You may register multiple providers for the same type.  In this case, the
store will use the provider with the highest *weight*.

```python
def give_me_another_thing() -> Thing:
    return Thing("Another Thing")

store.register_provider(give_me_another_thing, weight=10)
print(get_things_name())  # prints "Another Thing"
```

### Temporary registration

Registration functions may be used as context managers to temporarily register
providers.

```python
def most_important_thing() -> Thing:
    return Thing("Most Important Thing")

with store.register_provider(most_important_thing, weight=20):
    print(get_things_name())  # prints "Most Important Thing"
print(get_things_name())  # prints "Another Thing"
```

### Undoing registration

Alternatively, you can hang on to the object returned by the `register_provider`
function, and call its `cleanup` method:

```python
token = store.register_provider(most_important_thing, weight=20)
print(get_things_name())  # prints "Most Important Thing"

token.cleanup()  # unregister
print(get_things_name())  # prints "Another Thing"
```

## Processors

Processors are functions that take an instance of a type and do something
with it, usually for the purpose of side effects.  Processors are registered
using the [`Store.register_processor`][in_n_out.Store.register_processor] method.

```python
@store.inject_processors
def get_things_name(thing: Thing) -> str:
    return thing.name

def greet_name(name: str):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

store.register_processor(greet_name)

get_things_name(Thing('Bob'))  # prints "Hello, Bob!"  (and still returns "Bob")
```

!!!warning "Careful"
    Naturally, you want to be a bit careful with processors. It would be rather
    unusual to register a processor for something as common as `str` as we
    did above. Or, at the very least, we wouldn't inject processors into a
    function that returned `str`.

## Real world example

Let's look at a more realistic example.

Suppose we have an application like a text editor or IDE that allows plugins to
provide functionality like syntax highlighting, code completion, etc.  We might
allow plugins to define functions that accept a `Document` and use it's API to
provide additional functionality.

Rather than asking plugins to call some `get_current_document()` function, we
can allow them to write functions that state their dependencies using type hints,
and then *we* (the application) determine how we will provide those dependencies.

```python title="some_plugin.py"
def highlight_document(document: Document):
    # do something with the document
    pass
```

```python title="my_application.py"
from in_n_out import Store

# create a store
store = Store.create('my-store')

# register a Document provider
@store.register_provider
def get_current_document() -> Document:
    # get the current document from somewhere
    ...

# somehow gather functionality from plugins
from some_plugin import highlight_document

plugin_functions = [highlight_document]

# inject dependencies into plugin functions
injected = [store.inject(f) for f in plugin_functions]
```

Now we can call the injected functions, and they will have access
to the current document.

### `app-model`

In a GUI, one often needs to be able to call functions in response to
user actions, such as selection of a menu item or a button click.
However, those commands usually want some additional arguments or
context.  Dependency injection provides a nice way to handle this
problem with loose coupling.

See [`app-model`](https://github.com/pyapp-kit/app-model) for an
example of a library that uses `in-n-out` to inject dependencies
into commands in the context of a GUI application.

`Store` class and its methods.
